# TypeScript Library Template

This is a base template for any new TypeScript + React libraries I build. It is using Rollup as a build tool with some appropriate plugins that are common for libraries built with Rollup.

## Publishing a package

1. Upgrade the version number of the package
2. Commit the version bump
3. Run `yarn build`
4. Run `npm publish`
